We talk about freedom as if it were a solo act, but it is choreographed with others. To choose well is to acknowledge that someone else is choosing alongside you.

Boundaries do not end the conversation; they frame it. A rule can be a guardrail, a way of saying we want the drive to stay beautiful and not end in the ditch.
