We look for virtue in ancient texts, but it often hides in the way we hold a door or pause to listen. A small action becomes a rehearsal for the character we want to become.

When Aristotle talked about habits, he was pointing to a kind of quiet muscle memory. Practice kindness until it is as ordinary as breathing, and you end up building a self that knows how to choose the good without drama.
